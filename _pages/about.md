👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I completed my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Tribhuvan University, Nepal.

🔬 My research interests include developing AI technologies for social good!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of High Resolution Face Restoration and Swapping.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 CEO, Co-founder, Kalki I.O.T. Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
I have and experience of leading a team of driven engineers to develop hardware and software solutions for clients. I also led two different projects through the company namely [Mushoor](https://shishir441.github.io/portfolio/mushoor/) and [IRA](https://shishir441.github.io/portfolio/IRA/). Through Mushoor we designed and built a fully automated system to enable underemployed and unemployed population to earn a surplus income and nutrition. And, through IRA we enabled PSC and TSC aspirants in Nepal to access preparation classes online at very affordable rates.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching Experience
I worked as a part-time lecturer of "Programming in C" course in Cosmos College of Management and Technology for a semester. Also, I worked as an IQ and Computer Science tutor for Teacher Service Commission Aspirants through IRA.

To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
