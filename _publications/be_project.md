CubeSats tumble with high angular velocity after it is deployed into orbitdue to the asymmetric force of deployment. This initial spin is not suitable for preciseattitude control. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the angular velocity of CubeSatto some acceptable value before switching to attitude control strategy. This processof damping spin, known as detumbling is often performed by utilizing the Earth’smagnetic ﬁeld. In this paper, numerical simulation of CubeSat detumbling by usinga variant of B-Dot controller with angular velocity feedback is presented. The rota-tional dynamics of CubeSat is simulated using the RK4 integration of equations ofrigid body kinematics and Euler’s second law of motion. CubeSat is propagated inlow Earth orbit (LEO) using Kepler’s equation of orbital motion. The internationalgeomagnetic reference ﬁeld (IGRF) model is used to ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld strengthin the body frame as the satellite propagates in orbit, spinning on its way. Cube-Sat is equipped with three magnetorquers, three-axis magnetometer, and three-axis gyroscope.
